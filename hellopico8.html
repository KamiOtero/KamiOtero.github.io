    <h2>Hello World the PICO-8 edition</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Below I loaded in the demos floder from PICO and ran their Jelpi game for a moment</p>

    <p>Thanks to PixcelDev, I found this liner tween example that I could copy/paste into the cart and then run found here --> <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=31241">Hello PICO !!!</a> </p>

    <p>Quickly accidently realizing Shift+H did a pixel art symbol instead of an H, I added a little heart after I printed my name. Pretty cool.</p>

    <p>I have been wanting to play Celeste for a while but havnt yet so it caught my eye while exploring the splore :)</p>

    <p>I noticed by typing "folder" into the terminal in PICO, it automatically brings up the folder you are working in. Very helpful.</p>
